There is only **1** boss in the game currently, being **Soltera**.

<hr>

## Soltera
Soltera spawns on room 40, saying the following dialog:
"HALT! You shall not pass. You have not been permitted to enter these sacred grounds... I see.... 
You've been terrorising the local droids? You monster! Your end is here, and now."

## Attacks:

| Attack | Tips |
|-|-|
"Perish!" : Gives everyone in a radius slowness, then does 3 slashes in that radius. | Jump while moving to get out.
"The flames shall rule over all!": Moves from player to player attacking rapidly. | Run away from Soltera when you see that in chat.
"The flames shall heal my wounds." Heals herself. | Attack the boss as this only happens if you havent attacked Soltera in a while.

# Levels

Levels (Referred to as "Rooms inside the main game") are in groups of 10 in RGDs, containing 9 randomly chosen maps depending on the current group of rooms, progressively becoming more difficult over time, and a shop room that has a friendly droid hosting a small offering of 3 different items. Depending on the level, there may be a boss fight, or short encounter. There are currently **90** playable rooms with plans for more.

Be careful, your vision is very limited here, so a Shark Droid may get you!

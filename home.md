As of right now, there are 9 floors in the game, each with 10 rooms each. the first 9 rooms of each floor are randomly chosen prebuilt rooms with Droids that spawn inside. Once all droids in a room are defeated, the next room opens. The 10th and final room of each floor is a shop, where players can spend Circuits gained from slaying droids to buy a variety of Items.

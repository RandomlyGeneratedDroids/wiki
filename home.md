# Randomly Generated Droids Wiki

**Randomly Generated Droids (DF)** is a Minecraft Minigame on the Diamondfire server for 1.20.4 based on the Roblox game of the same name.

**RGD (DF)**, is a roguelike in which you complete a series of floors via killing Droids, gaining items along the way to aid you. As of right now, there are 9 <a href="levels.html">Levels</a> in the game, each with 10 rooms each. The first 9 rooms of each <a href="levels.html">Level</a> are randomly chosen prebuilt rooms with Droids that spawn inside. Once all droids in a room are defeated, the next room opens. The 10th and final room of each <a href="levels.html">Level</a> is a shop, where players can spend Circuits gained from slaying droids to buy a variety of <a href="items.html">Items</a>.

# Kits

Kits are an essential part of the game, as you are forced to use one of them every game, and these may even change how you play. There are currently **14** kits, being these:

# Brawler <img src="assets/images/Stone_Sword.webp" width="24px">

*"The brawler utilizes simple but effective moves that increase the brawlers damage over time. Very easy for new players."* - The ingame inventory.

Brawler is one of the two starter kits, along with <a href="#Sv">Survivalist</a>.

## Description

Brawler is a close-ranged attacker, with good survivability and great starting damage output. This class does especially well in the early game.

## Abilities

The Brawler has one starting weapon, as well as two abilities and one passive.

| Name | Uses | Description |
|-|-|-|
| Brawler Blade | N/A | In game description says 8 Damage, when in reality it only does 4. This low damage is offset by its high attack speed. |
| Courage |	5 Energy | Gain Strength 1 for 30 seconds. |
| Bandages | 8 Energy | Heals 4 health instantly, and gives Regeneration 2 for 30 seconds. This always totals to a full heal for the Brawler class.|
| Red Heart | N/A | You heal for 1 health each new room. Passive. |

### Trivia
* Brawler's heal doesn't mention the regeneration in the game description. This means that players expecting a 4 health heal end up getting a full heal instead.
* Brawler's weapon was originally a copper sword, being changed to a stronger weapon for balancing.

# Survivalist <img src="assets/images/Shield.webp" width="24px">

*"The survivalist can keep themselves safe throughout runs, being able to give themselves defense boosts and heal much more."* - The ingame inventory.

Survivalist is one of the two starter kits, along with <a href="#Br">Brawler</a>.

## Description

Survivalist is a close-ranged attacker that is able to block out dangerous attacks and outlive most other classes.

## Items & Abilities

The Survivalist has four items, two of which are abilities and one of which is a passive.

| Name | Uses | Description |
|-|-|-|
| Tough Shield | N/A | Deals 5 damage per hit, which is ironically higher than <a href="#Br">Brawler</a>. The attack speed, however, is rather low. Gives +5 Max Health while held.|
| Shield |	3 Energy | Gain Resistance 6 for 4 seconds. |
| Restore | 8 Energy | Heals for 5 health. If the player is currently below 4 health, they heal for 10 instead. |
| Red Heart | N/A | You heal for 1 health each new room. Passive. |

### Trivia

* Survivalist used to have a copper sword.
* Before the <a href="#Br">Brawler</a> buff, Survivalist was the best starting class by a longshot.
* Survivalist's Shield is one of the cheapest invincibility moves next to <a href="#Ad">Adventurer</a>.

*"The Adventurer has an incredibly plain kit, but in turn gains x2 circuits from picking them up."* - The ingame inventory.

## Description

| Adventurer Blade | N/A | 6 Damage + Fire Damage (9 damage total). |
| Dash (Adventurer Blade) |	1 Energy | Move forward 5 blocks when on ground, and 12 in the air. You gain resistance while dashing. |

### Trivia
